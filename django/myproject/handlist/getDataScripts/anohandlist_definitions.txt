 • hs(1): HEAD SCALES: Smooth: 1,1. Striate or rugose: 2,2. Unicarinate: 3,3.  Multicarinate: 4,4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1.
     Recognition of smooth, more or less ribbed (striate) or rugose head scales or those with strong single ridges (unicarinate) or strong multiple ridges (multicarinate) should not be difficult. The coding for any individual  specimen should reflect the most extreme condition in terms of keeling (the highest number, i.e. 3,3 or 4,4, less frequently 1,1 or 2,2. For series, code the range of variation, e.g. 3,4 or 1,2 or 1,3. 
  • snsc(2): SCALES ACROSS SNOUT BETWEEN SECOND CANTHALS: 2-25. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1.
     Because they are better defined posteriorly, the canthals are counted from the eye forward.  The first canthal always extends from the canthal ridge backward over the orbit; the second has no such extension.
     This is not necessarily an easy count to make. Variation accounts for some of problem. At the lower range of counts, variation in counts within a species should not exceed 1 or 2 , but may be 4 or more at the higher extremes. But more important is the irregularity in size and position of the pertinent scales. Since two or more scales may be in contact with the second canthal on each side, counts within one individual by different observers or by one observer at different times may differ by one or more scales. It is not useful to require that this be minimum count, With any matrix based on a sample of 20 or more, apparent discrepancies should not matter. For matrices based on few specimens this may be a genuine problem requiring recounting or use of judgement as to whether the differences are meaningful or not. 
  • pr(3): POSTROSTRALS: 3-12. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1.
     The scales behind the rostral, in contact with it, and between the supralabials are easily counted and will usually not vary within a species by more than 2 to 3. 
  • n(4): NASAL: Circumnasal: 0,0. Anterior nasal: 1,1. Divided anterior nasal: 2,2. Inferior nasal: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Figs. 1, 2, and especially 3.
     The nasal in Anolis may be a single oval scale that contains the nostril. It is then coded as "circumnasal": 0,0.  More often the scales around the nasal are differentiated, overlap, and at least partially obscure it.  Most common is a condition in which a scale anterior to the nasal becomes large and subtriangular and overlaps part of the nasal scale; it is then coded as "anterior nasal": 1,1.  In some species the anterior nasal is divided transversely; it is then reported as a "divided anterior nasal": 2,2.  The other scales overlapping the nasal are not considered, except that the inferior nasal - a scale obscuring the lower surface of the nasal - if it comes to overlie the sulcus between the rostral and the first supralabial - is then, and only then, coded "inferior nasal": 3,3.  Occasional anomalies, e.g., an anterior nasal replaced by small granules, or conditions due to injury should always be reported as NA.
     Note that the sulci bounding the scales surrounding and overlapping the nasal are sometimes obscure, and that, therefore, the existence, for example, of the anterior nasal must be inferred.  Most often, the plausible coding will be 1,1.  These difficulties should, in any event, exist only in single specimens or one side of a single individual.  Series should obviate or alleviate the problem. 
  • n-r(5): SCALES BETWEEN NASAL AND ROSTRAL: 0-4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 2A. 
     In anoline lizards with the condition "circumnasal" - the simple unmodified nasal scale - that scale may be in contact with the rostral: one or more scales almost always intervene.  The minimum number is coded.  In the condition "anterior nasal," the nasal itself is obscured, but the anterior nasal is usually in contact with the sulcus between rostral and first supralabial.  This condition is coded 0,0.  If the anterior nasal is wholly in contact with the rostral, and the inferior nasal has moved into a position above the sulcus between rostral and first supralabial, the coding is still 0,0.  If, however,  anterior nasal is separated from the rostral by one or more scales, in this case the minimum count is recorded.
  • ssc(6): SCALES BETWEEN THE SUPRAORBITAL SEMICIRCLES: 0-8. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1.
     This is a minimum count.  Any contact, even a point contact, between the supraorbital semicircles is scored as 0,0.
  • esd(7): ENLARGED SCALES IN THE SUPRAOCULAR DISK: 0-30. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1.
     Enlarged scales arranged as a supraocular disk may be conspicuously larger than any surrounding scales; they are then easily countable.  In many or most species, however, there is gradation such that all counts are subjective; in such cases a range should be reported.  In still other species the enlargement is so gradual and so limited that there can be no pretense of an accurate count.  These cases should be coded arbitrarily as 30,30.  If there is no indication of a disk or of significant enlargement of any of the supraocular scales, the coding should be 0,0.
     In many or most species of anoles this is not the most useful of characters.  It is useful in those cases in which the disk consists of a few large scales that are sharply distinct from surrounding scales.  High counts, i.e., smaller scales, are ordinarily subjective and imply gradation.  It is possible to be undecided whether the coding should be 30,30 or 0,0.  Specimens or species for which this occurs should be coded 0,30.  The computer will match this with any count between 0 and 30, although no species is known in which so highly variable a condition is true.  If, in fact, you have before you any series containing low counts (large scales) in the supraocular disk and also high counts (20-30) as well as 0,0, that series should be suspect as composite, and low and high count (and 0,0) specimens treated separately.
  • esc(8): ELONGATE SUPERCILIARIES: 0-4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Figs. 1, 2, and 4. 
     The first superciliary in Anolis is usually distinguishable from more posterior superciliaries by being much longer anteroposteriorly. If there is more than one elongate superciliary - there may be as many as 4 - they will be strongly overlapping and grade in length posteriorly. In some species there is no elongate superciliary, and the coding is then 0,0.
  • scs(9): SUPERCILIARY SERIES: Granules: 1,1. Small scales: 2,2. Larger square or swollen scales: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Figs. 1, 2, and 4. 
     The scales posterior to the elongate superciliary - if one is present - may be granular, like the smaller scales of the supraocular area, and are then coded 1,1. Alternatively, there may be one or two rows of distinctly larger but still small scales following the elongate superciliary or superciliaries; the coding then is 2,2. If there is difficulty in deciding between these two conditions, or if there is a mixture of granules and small scales, the code should be 1,2. If there is no elongate supercilary and all superciliaries are large and squarish or large and swollen, the conditions should be coded 3,3. The large and squarish and large and swollen superciliaries are rare conditions, known only in certain  species in Ecuador, Colombia, Panama.
  • lorr(10): LOREAL ROWS: 2-12. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 2.
     Loreal rows are counted down from the second canthal or from the first canthal, if it clearly overlaps the loreal area. (The scales that continue the subocular arc in front of the eye are preoculars, not loreals.)
  • lorn(10): LOREAL NUMBER: 8-40. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 2. 
     Total loreal number is easily counted when the loreals are few and the suboculars broadly in contact with the supralabials. Difficulty occurs when the loreals are confluent with a scale row or rows separating the subocular and supralabials. Whenever such a row is complete, the number of loreals will, in any case, be relatively high (significantly > 30); it is then convenient to use the arbitrary coding 40,40. Low counts may be diagnostic for certain species; high counts do not seem to be useful for species discrimination.
  • ip/e(12): INTERPARIETAL RELATIVE TO EAR: Interparietal absent: NA. 
Much smaller: 0,0. Smaller: 1,1. Equal to: 2,2. Larger: 3,3. Much larger: 4,4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Figs. 1, 2, and 5.
     The size of interparietal relative to the size of the ear is ordinarily unambiguous. If there is ambiguity or variation within a species, code as a range, e.g., 1-3. Again extreme conditions tend to be diagnostic, but in many species codings of 1, 2, and 3 will be appropriate within a single population. 
  • ip/sc(13): SCALES BETWEEN INTERPARIETAL AND SEMICIRCLES: 0-15. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Fig. 1.
     If there is no interparietal, the coding of this character must be NA. There is again a minimum count taken on each side from the interparietal to the nearest scales of the supraorbital semicircles. If the two sides differ, score, for example, 2,3.
  • ip/n(14): SCALES BETWEEN THE INTERPARIETAL AND NAPE SCALES: Enlarged scales behind the interparietal distinctly larger than nape scales: 0-15. Scales Scales behind interparietal grading into nape scales: 50,50. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 1. 
     This count is made in the approximate midline behind the interparietal and is a minimum count for any longitudinal series of scales that are appreciably larger than the nape scales immediately behind them. If there is gradation, and this is often the case, the count may be subjective. If so, code as a range. 
     This is another case in which high numbers (smaller scales) may be closer taxonomically to 0 than to low numbers. A count of 0 has a taxonomic meaning whenever an interparietal is followed immediately by small scales not significantly different from the nape scales. This differs importantly from those instances in which the scales behind the interparietal differ abruptly  in size from the nape scales. Difficulty arises  when there has to be subjective decision in regard to the abruptness of the change in size. If gradation begins immediately behind the interparietal code 50,50. If gradation begins any distance behind the interparietal, count the unequivocally enlarged scales and add, after a comma, 50: e.g. 4, 50.
  • so/sl(15): SCALE ROWS BETWEEN SUBOCULARS AND SUPRALABIALS: 0-3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Fig. 2. 
     This is also a minimum count. Any contact between suboculars and supralabials is coded 0,0.
  • sl(16): SUPRALABIALS TO BELOW THE CENTER OF THE EYE: 4-12. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 2.
     The supralabials are counted from the rostral posteriorly.  The sulcus between two supralabials may lie below the center of the eye.  The coding is then a range, e.g. 6-7.
  • pm(17): POSTMENTALS: 2-12. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 3.
     This is a count of all the scales in contact with the mental between the infralabials. It includes the anteriormost sublabials, if these are differentiated.
  • sl(18): SUBLABIALS: 0-2. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 3.
     A sublabial series is an abruptly enlarged series of scales on each side paralleling the infralabials.  "Abruptly enlarged" means that the first sublabial of each side is at least four to five times the size of the postmental medial to it.  If no such abruptly enlarged scales adjacent to the infralabials exist, i.e., if the postmentals are subequal or grade evenly from larger laterally to smaller medially, or if the enlarged scales are only twice to three times any medial gular, this is to be reported as the absence of sublabials, coded 0,0.  If both first sublabials are present, the coding is 2,2. If, as sometimes happens, a first sublabial is present on one side only, the coding is 0,1.  If there is ambiguity, i.e code 0,2. 
  • sl/il(19): SUBLABIALS IN CONTACT WITH INFRALABIALS: 0-9. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 3.
     In anoles the first sublabials, when present, are almost always in contact with the first infralabials. If the first sublabial is, as rarely may be the case, separated from the first infralabial by a lateral gular, the coding is, of course, 0,0. Any more posterior sublabials (= abruptly enlarged scales in sequence with the first) may also be in contact with the infralabials, or some or all of them may be separated by a row of smaller scales. If only the first sublabials are in contact with infralabials, or there are no posterior sublabials, the coding is 1,1. In some species there may be as many as 9 in contact, and the number often differs on the two sides, e.g. 1,2 or 6,7. If there are no sublabials at all the coding is 0,0.
  • d(20): DORSALS: Smooth: 1,1. Tuberculate: 2,2. Unicarinate: 3,3. Multicarinate: 4,4. Triangular or conical crest scales: 5,5. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Fig. 4.
     These conditions should be readily recognizable, but if there is any ambiguity, code a range. 
  • middr(21): ENLARGED MIDDORSAL ROWS: 0-30. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 4.
     There may be subjectivity in counts of enlarged middorsal rows. In all such cases, code not single numbers but an appropriate range of values. If the enlarged middorsal rows are not countable because of too gradual transition to the flank scales, code arbitrarily as 30,30. As in certain other counts low counts may be more meaningful and repeatable than high counts. A count of 2,2 or 4,4 may, for example, be more distinct from 0,0 than a count of 30,30. 
  • middc(22): MIDDORSAL CRESTS: None: 0,0. Low crest: 1,1. High crest: 2,2. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 4A.
     In anoles "crest" is applied only to one or two rows of sharply enlarged middorsal scales, characteristically triangular or conical, of varying height but always projecting conspicuously above the paravertebral scales. Most anoles lack such crests. 
  • fs(23): FLANK SCALES: Widely separated: 0,0. Juxtaposed: 1,1. Imbricate: 2,2. Heterogeneous: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Figs. 4 and 4B.
     In some species, the flank scales may be separated by one or rarely more rows of more or less minute granules.  This condition is coded 0,0. Much more frequently the flank scales are smaller, and some or all of them are narrowly separated by naked skin or by minute granules, which may allow partial contact. This condition is coded 0,1. Many species have the flank scales juxtaposed; this is coded 1,1. If any of the flank scales clearly overlap, the coding is 2,2. In some few species, the larger scales of the flank may be of very unequal size; these are then scored as heterogeneous: 3,3. The minute granules, which may be present in such cases, are not considered in this definition of heterogeneity. 
  • v/d(24): VENTRALS RELATIVE TO DORSALS: Larger: 1,1. Equal: 2,2. Smaller: 3,3. Much smaller: 4,4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 4.
     Most anole species have the ventrals larger than the largest dorsals. This may, however, be untrue for species with a distinct zone of enlarged dorsals, or those species with crest scales. There may even be noticeable variation in this regard within species. As usual, such variation is coded as a range. The condition "ventrals much smaller than dorsals" is best known  in Chamaeleolis. 
  • vs/k(25): VENTRALS: Smooth: 1,1. Weakly keeled : 2,2. Strongly keeled: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 4.
     Some species are truly variable, with ventrals in some individuals keeled, in others smooth. Series from such species should be coded 1,2 or 1,3, as appropriate, individuals either 1,1, 2,2, or 3,3. Other species have keeling so weak that it is a subjective judgment whether it exists at all. Individuals in such species may be coded either 1,2 or 2,2.  Only scales of the posterior belly are considered under this character.  Chest scales smooth or keeled may be useful in distinguishing some species, but this condition has not been recorded in the Dictionary. 
  • vj/i(26): VENTRALS: Separated: 0,0. Juxtaposed: 1,1. Subimbricate: 2,2. Imbricate: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 4. 
     Ventrals are sometimes separated by naked skin or granules, often are juxtaposed or intermediate (subimbricate) or distinctly overlapping (imbricate). More than one condition can occur within a species or even within an individual.
  • A/N(27): TOE PADS: No pads: 0,0. Pad overlapping first phalanx: 1,1. Pad not distinct from first phalanx: 2,2. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 5A.
     In most species of Anolis the adhesive pad under phalanges 2 and 3 of all the toes projects distally under the proximal infradigital scales of the first (claw-bearing) phalanx. This is coded 1,1. In a number of species, not closely related, the projection is minimal or absent, and the proximal termination of the pad is therefore indistinct (coded 2,2). In the adults of one species only, a pad is completely lacking (coded 0,0). 
  • l(28): LAMELLAR NUMBER: 0-50. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 5.
     Lamellae are the widened distally overlapping scales characteristic of the adhesive toe pads of anoles. Counts are made only on the fourth toe of the hind foot. A given range of lamellar counts is species-specific.  Counting lamellar number, as understood here, involves finding the bend between phalanx 3 and phalanx 4; this is arbitrarily considered the proximal termination of the adhesive pad. A bend also occurs within the pad between phalanges 2 and 3, but the distal termination is defined as the joint between phalanges 1 and 2. Counts are therefore restricted to the lamellae under phalanges 2 and 3. At the joint between phalanges 3 and 4, the scale at or within the bend is counted. Distally the small terminal lamella of the pad projection is always counted, or, in default of such a scale, the scale that lies across the joint between phalanges 1 and 2. The intention here is to count only scales of the pad proper. For most anole species the procedure outlined above probably closely approximates reality. However, scanning electron microscopy has revealed that, in fact, the adhesive lamellae with the functionally adhesive hairs are not necessarily confined within the boundaries of phalanges 2 and 3. However, these boundaries provide a convenient macrostructural definition on which to base reproducible counts. Ultimately, however, the justification for this count, rather than counts of all lamellae under the fourth toe, is historical: Boulenger (1889), who first provided standard recognizable descriptions of anole species, used the count of lamellae under phalanges 2 and 3. Stejneger, Cochran, and Schwartz and Williams have routinely used the same count.
  • sd(29): SUPRADIGITALS: Smooth: 1,1. With indistinct or single keels: 2,2. Multicarinate: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. 
     Most anoles have multicarinate supradigital scales. The alternative conditions - smooth (1,1) or with indistinct, usually single keels (2,2) are quite uncommon, and, therefore, when they do occur, highly diagnostic.
  • t(30): TAIL: Round: 1,1. Weakly compressed: 2,2. Strongly compressed: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 6.
     Strongly compressed tails are readily recognized. Weakly compressed or round tails are common. 
  • tc(31): TAIL CREST: None: 0,0. Serrate: 1,1. Distinct crest: 2,2. High crest: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Figs. 6 and 6A. 
     Round tails have no crests. Weakly compressed tails may or may not be serrate above. Strongly compressed tails may or may not have a crest, may not even be serrate above, and, if present, the crest may be high or low. Variation from population to population within a species is not unusual.
  • pa(32): POSTANALS. Present: 1,1. Obscure: 2,2. Absent: 3,3. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Fig. 7.
     Fig. 7 shows the characteristic enlarged postanal scales of male anoles and some alternative conditions. These scales may be large or small, fused or, in other ways, obscure, or, as in males of not a few species, and always in females, absent. 
  • mdew(33): MALE DEWLAP: Large: 1,1. Intermediate: 2,2. Small: 3,3. Absent: 4,4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. Fig. 8. 
     Dewlaps should be scored as large if they extend onto the belly past the insertion of the arms, intermediate if they reach just the level of the axilla, small if they are shorter than this. If the animal is female, code NA. 
     Large (1,1), as defined here, is a very inclusive term, and species so coded will differ conspicuously in dewlap area. The present definition has been adopted to avoid the problem of quantifying dewlap area, and to permit the scoring of dewlaps that are not extended in preserved animals. 
  • fdew(34): FEMALE DEWLAP: Large: 1,1. Intermediate: 2,2. Small: 3,3. Absent: 4,4. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.  Fig. 8.
     Females
  • msize(35): MALE SNOUT-VENT MAXIMUM: 20-300. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. 
     Snout-vent length should be measured on every specimen. The number with which this length is compared in the coded matrix is the maximum known for the relevant sex in each species. Only if the matrix number is exceeded by a substantial margin should a tentative identification be rejected. 
     A female should be coded NA. 
  • fsize(36): FEMALE SNOUT-VENT MAXIMUM: 20-300. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA. 
The principles suggested for the interpretation of the comparable entry in males apply here also. For a male code this entry NA. 
  • tl/bl(37): TAIL LENGTH/BODY LENGTH: About equal: 1,1. Tail about 1 and 1/2 times body length: 2,2. Tail about 2 times body length: 3,3. Tail about 2.5 times body length: 4,4. Tail 2.8 and more times body length: 5,5. Unavailable: UA. Not applicable: NA.
     Tail length should be measured whenever the tail is neither broken nor regenerated. (The regenerated portion of a lizard tail always differs in scale form from the unregeneration portion; such difference in scale form is never seen in an unregenerated tail.)
     The measured tail length must then be compared with the snout-vent length, and the ratio of snout-vent length over tail length obtained. Ratios between 0.8 and 1.2 should be coded 1,1. Ratios between 1.3 and 1.7 may be coded 2,2, those between 1.8 and 2.2 may be coded 3,3, those between 2.3 and 2.7 coded 4,4, those between 2.8 and 3 or more 5,5. Series will frequently show intermediate coding, and all intermediates should be so coded, e.g. individuals with ratios 2.75 as 4,5, series with ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.9 as 2,3.
